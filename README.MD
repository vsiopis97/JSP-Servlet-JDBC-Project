# AJAX-JSON-JQUERY-Project

A single-page application that works with AJAX and JQuery. It trades JSON messages with the server.
The implementation is done by using a Rest Controller located inside the main application of the master branch and using the database of the master branch application.

The function of the application is fetching a random user of a database with the push of a button. The button is limited to 10 uses and disappears after the 10th use.
